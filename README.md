## About
The Voting System is a web appplication created by a group of software engineering students at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.

## Features

- Ballots contain multiple electoral races and an issue to vote on.
- A public voter list is made avaible to any third party to view who has or hasn't voted. However, that third party will not be able to view *whom* they have voted for.
- Client-side Form Validation
