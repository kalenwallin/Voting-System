Just testing for the group project of CSCE 361. When it comes, it will be nice to know how to do all this stuff.

**Changelog:**

Added github webhook to discord server.

Notes: Everything that happens to the GitHub Repository will be sent to the discord server in the channel *#git-commit-log*
